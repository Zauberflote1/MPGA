### Response from gpt-3.5-turbo

Firstly, Aristotle recognizes that there are different opinions about the nature of substance. Some believe that there is nothing substantial besides sensible things, while others posit eternal substances that are more in number and more real. Plato, for example, posited two kinds of substance - the Forms and objects of mathematics - as well as a third kind, namely the substance of sensible bodies.

Speusippus, on the other hand, made even more kinds of substance, starting with the One and assuming principles for each kind of substance, one for numbers, another for spatial magnitudes, and so on. By going on in this way, he multiplies the kinds of substance.

Furthermore, some say that Forms and numbers have the same nature, and the other things come after them - lines and planes - until we come to the substance of the material universe and to sensible bodies.

Given these different views, it is necessary to inquire which of the common statements are right and which are not right, and what substances there are, and whether there are or are not any besides.

With regard to matter, Aristotle recognizes that it is generally recognized as the substance which exists as underlying and as matter, i.e., that which exists potentially. However, it remains to be said what is the substance, in the sense of actuality, of sensible things.

Democritus seems to think that there are three kinds of difference between things; the underlying body, the matter, is one and the same, but they differ either in rhythm, i.e. shape, or in turning, i.e. position, or in inter-contact, i.e. order. But evidently, there are many differences. For instance, some things are characterized by the mode of composition of their matter, e.g. the things formed by blending, such as honey-water; and others by being bound together, e.g. bundle.

Now, Aristotle argues that a thing primarily is thought to be in the truest sense its substance. And in one sense matter is said to be of the nature of substratum, in another, shape, and in a third, the compound of these. By the matter, for instance, Aristotle means the bronze, by the shape the pattern of its form, and by the compound of these the statue, the concrete whole.

Therefore, if the form is prior to the matter and more real, it will be prior also to the compound of both, for the same reason. Aristotle thus outlines the nature of substance, showing that it is that which is not predicated of a stratum but of which all else is predicated.

However, this statement is still obscure, and on this view, matter becomes substance. For if this is not substance, it baffles us to say what else is. When all else is stripped off, evidently nothing but matter remains. For while the rest are affections, products, and potencies of bodies, substance is different from any of these.

Therefore, Aristotle concludes that matter cannot be substance. Both separability and ‘thisness’ are thought to belong chiefly to substance. And so form and the compound of form and matter would be thought to be substance, rather than matter. The substance compounded of both, i.e. of matter and shape, may be dismissed, for it is posterior and its nature is obvious. And matter also is in a sense manifest.

But we must inquire into the third kind of substance, for this is the most perplexing. In summary, Aristotle argues against matter being substance and proposes that form and the compound of form and matter are substance in the truest sense.
