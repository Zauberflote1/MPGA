How to explain Aristotle book A?

Book A of Aristotle's Metaphysics introduces the topic of the work, theoretical wisdom (sophia), and later the science of being qua being (Γ 1 1003a21). It then looks at and critiques what earlier thinkers (especially Plato) have said about these topics, concluding that none of them introduces any beyond the four (material, efficient, final, and formal) that Aristotle has himself identified and explored in the Physics. Book A then lists and goes through a set of fourteen aporiai or puzzles (P1–14) that the science of being qua being must resolve.
